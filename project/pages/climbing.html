            <h2>Why I climb</h2>
            <p>I am a very avid climber during the summer, though I often stop during the school year.</p>
            <p>I really like the level of stability and strength needed for rock climbing, and I got really into training for it.
                The part I really love is how many cool "tricks" it unlocks. Most of which sort of look like the stuff you'd see 
                in a New York Subway, swinging from the bars and such.
