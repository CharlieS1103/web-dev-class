                        <h3>Chaos Chess</h3>
                        <p>A chess game with a twist. Many different custom gamemodes are available.</p>
                        <p>
                            I made this project as a way to learn how to integrate a full website with
                            both a backend and a frontend. It was also inspired by my interest in chess,
                            and served as a playground for my own original gamemodes.

                        <h3>Spicetify Marketplace</h3>
                        <p>
                            A marketplace for Spicetify users to install and manage themes and extensions
                            using inline-linking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project was the result of a need for a marketplace within Spicetify.
                            Users used to manually download themes/extensions and edit config files.
                            The UI enables installation while working around the limitations of a modded
                            client with no filesystem access.
