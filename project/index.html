            <p>
                I'm a Sophomore majoring in English. I have a pet cat named Toast. Some of my interests include climbing, reading, and software development. This page is about all of those, and subsequently, me.

                    <p>
                        The following, aside from my contact address, are all things which I love dearly. 
                        Toast understands me to a degree that no other can. In all honesty, I could do without climbing in particular, but 
                        activity is important to me. And reading has always been a passion of mine, as a kid my parents would often get mad at 
                        me for staying up all night reading, I would carry around a book at summer camp, I was that kind of kid. 
                        I also have a lot of fun projects that I've worked on, and I hope to do more in the future. It's definitely more love hate for those though.
